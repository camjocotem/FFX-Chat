## FFX-styled chat

This is a just-for-fun project mimicking the original menu style of Final Fantasy X in chat format.
Chatting in this app will convert anything you say into the in-game language of al-bhed.

While serving no practical usage, I imagine it can be appreciated as a fan of the particular game :)
